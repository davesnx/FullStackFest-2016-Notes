## Full Stack Fest 2016
This repo contains a small draft of some concepts expressed of each talk about Full Stack Fest.

Tried to represent in the notes the way of the speaker was talking, some of them are splitted by sections, some of them by code examples, some of them of a list of stuff.

As soon as I have the Records of the Talks I will add it here.
