```css

.gridable-element {
  display: grid;
    /* That apply the grid into the DOMElement */
  grid-column: 1 / 6;
    /*
      Here comes the magic:
        grid-column allows to spread the space of this element into the horitzontal
        flow.

        Like this:

            +---------------------------------------+
            |                                       |
            |  +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+  |
            |  |   | |   | |   | |   | |   | |   |  |
            |  +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+  |
            |                                       |
            +---------------------------------------+

          so grid-column will be a notation like X / Y
          being X / Y a precentatge of space on the hole thing
    */

  grid-row: 1 / 2;
    /*
        Sort of the same idea as column, but vertically, something like:

            +------------------+
            |                  |
            | +--------------+ |
            | |              | |
            | |              | |
            | |              | |
            | +--------------+ |
            |                  |
            | +--------------+ |
            | |              | |
            | |              | |
            | |              | |
            | +--------------+ |
            |                  |
            +------------------+
     */

  grid-grap: 10px;
    /* That allows the inner-space between the elements
        Note: In px is the only that actually works, percents breaks so hard.
    */
}
